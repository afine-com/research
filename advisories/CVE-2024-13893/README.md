# CVE-2024-13893
Smartwares cameras - Shared Credentials

## Timeline
- Vulnerability reported to CERT Polska: 13.11.2024
- Public disclosure: 06.03.2025

## Description

Shared Credentials vulnerability affects Smartwares cameras, including models CIP-37210AT and C724IP, as well as other devices using the same firmware up to version 3.3.0. This flaw stems from hardcoded, shared credentials for the Telnet service, making it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access. The password hash can be retrieved via physical access to SPI-connected memory.

To enable Telnet, an SD card with a specifically named folder must be inserted into the device.

## Affected versions
<= 3.3.0

## Advisory
The vendor has not responded to reports regarding this issue, leaving the patching status uncertain. It is also unclear whether newer firmware versions remain vulnerable. No known fix is available. To mitigate potential risks, users are advised to:
* Restrict Physical Access: Prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the deviceâ€™s hardware.
* Restrict Network Access: Limit exposure by configuring network settings to prevent unauthorized access to port 23.
* Monitor Network Activity: Check for unauthorized Telnet connections.
* Network Segmentation: Block Telnet access from untrusted networks.
