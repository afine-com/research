# CVE-2025-42945
HTML Injection Vulnerability In SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP

## Timeline
- Vulnerability reported to vendor: 28.05.2025
- Public disclosure: 12.08.2025

## Description

SAP GUI for Windows may permit NTLM hash leakage when certain ABAP frontend services are invoked using UNC paths. For the attack to succeed, the attacker requires developer permissions on a specific ABAP Application Server to modify the code, and the victim must use SAP GUI for Windows to execute it. This could initiate automatic NTLM authentication, potentially exposing hashed credentials to the attacker. Consequently, this vulnerability significantly impacts confidentiality.
