# CVE-2024-49705
SoftCOM iKSORIS Internet Starter Module â€“ Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS)

## Timeline
- Vulnerability reported to vendor: 17.10.2024
- Public disclosure: 14.04.2025

## Description
A client-side Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in the Internet Starter module of SoftCOM iKSORIS. An attacker might trick a user into using a URL with the `d` parameter set to an unhandled value. All subsequent requests will not be accepted as the server returns an error message. Since this parameter is sent as part of a session cookie, the issue persists until the session expires or the user deletes cookies manually. A similar effect might be achieved when a user tries to change the platform language to an unimplemented one.

## Affected versions
- All versions prior to 79.0

## Advisory
The issue has been addressed in version 79.0 of the software. Users are strongly advised to update to this version to mitigate the vulnerability.
