# CVE-2025-42943
SAP GUI - NTLM Hash Hijacking via UNC Paths

## Timeline
- Vulnerability reported to vendor: 28.05.2025
- Public disclosure: 12.08.2025

## Description

SAP GUI for Windows may permit NTLM hash leakage when certain ABAP frontend services are invoked using UNC paths. For the attack to succeed, the attacker requires developer permissions on a specific ABAP Application Server to modify the code, and the victim must use SAP GUI for Windows to execute it. This could initiate automatic NTLM authentication, potentially exposing hashed credentials to the attacker. Consequently, this vulnerability significantly impacts confidentiality.

## Affected versions
<= 8.0 without SAP note 3627845 security update.

## Advisory
SAP has addressed this issue in their SAP note 3627845 security update. Users are strongly advised to apply the latest patches to mitigate potential risks associated with this vulnerability.
