# CVE-2025-42979 
SAP GUI - Insecure Key & Secret Management

## Timeline
- Vulnerability reported to vendor: 06.05.2025
- Public disclosure: 08.07.2025

## Description

The GuiXT application, which is integrated with SAP GUI for Windows, uses obfuscation algorithms instead of secure symmetric ciphers for storing the credentials of an RFC user on the client PC. This leads to a high impact on confidentiality because any attacker who gains access to the user hive of this user's windows registry could recreate the original password. There is no impact on integrity or availability of the application

## Affected versions
<= 8.0 without SAP note 3607513 security update.

## Advisory
SAP has addressed this issue in their SAP note 3607513 security update. Users are strongly advised to apply the latest patches to mitigate potential risks associated with this vulnerability.
